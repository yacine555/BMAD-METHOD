- [ ] Testing and validation are assigned to appropriate agents

## 5. FEATURE SEQUENCING & DEPENDENCIES

### 5.1 Functional Dependencies

- [ ] Features that depend on other features are sequenced correctly
- [ ] Shared components are built before their use
- [ ] User flows follow a logical progression
- [ ] Authentication features precede protected routes/features

### 5.2 Technical Dependencies

- [ ] Lower-level services are built before higher-level ones
- [ ] Libraries and utilities are created before their use

### 5.3 Cross-Epic Dependencies

- [ ] Later epics build upon functionality from earlier epics
- [ ] No epic requires functionality from later epics
- [ ] Infrastructure established in early epics is utilized consistently
- [ ] Incremental value delivery is maintained

## 6. MVP SCOPE ALIGNMENT

- [ ] All core goals defined in the PRD are addressed in epics/stories
- [ ] Features directly support the defined MVP goals
- [ ] No extraneous features beyond MVP scope are included
- [ ] Critical features are prioritized appropriately

### 6.2 User Journey Completeness

- [ ] Edge cases and error scenarios are addressed
- [ ] User experience considerations are included
- [ ] Accessibility requirements are incorporated if specified

### 6.3 Technical Requirements Satisfaction

- [ ] All technical constraints from the PRD are addressed
- [ ] Non-functional requirements are incorporated
- [ ] Architecture decisions align with specified constraints
- [ ] Performance considerations are appropriately addressed

## 7. RISK MANAGEMENT & PRACTICALITY

### 7.1 Technical Risk Mitigation

- [ ] Complex or unfamiliar technologies have appropriate learning/prototyping stories
- [ ] High-risk components have explicit validation steps
- [ ] Fallback strategies exist for risky integrations
- [ ] Performance concerns have explicit testing/validation
