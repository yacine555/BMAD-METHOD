## Infrastructure Verification

### Validation Framework

This infrastructure architecture will be validated using the comprehensive `infrastructure-checklist.md`, with particular focus on Section 12: Architecture Documentation Validation. The checklist ensures:

- Completeness of architecture documentation
- Consistency with broader system architecture
- Appropriate level of detail for different stakeholders
- Clear implementation guidance
- Future evolution considerations

### Validation Process

The architecture documentation validation should be performed:

- After initial architecture development
- After significant architecture changes
- Before major implementation phases
- During periodic architecture reviews

The Platform Engineer should use the infrastructure checklist to systematically validate all aspects of this architecture document.
