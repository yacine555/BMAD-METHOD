# Platform Infrastructure Implementation Task

## Purpose

To implement a comprehensive platform infrastructure stack based on the Infrastructure Architecture Document, including foundation infrastructure, container orchestration, GitOps workflows, service mesh, and developer experience platforms. This integrated approach ensures all platform components work synergistically to provide a complete, secure, and operationally excellent platform foundation.

## Inputs

- **Infrastructure Architecture Document** (`docs/infrastructure-architecture.md` - from Architect Agent)
- Infrastructure Change Request (`docs/infrastructure/{ticketNumber}.change.md`)
- Infrastructure Guidelines (`docs/infrastructure/guidelines.md`)
- Technology Stack Document (`docs/tech-stack.md`)
- `infrastructure-checklist.md` (for validation)

## Key Activities & Instructions

### 1. Confirm Interaction Mode

- Ask the user: "How would you like to proceed with platform infrastructure implementation? We can work:
  A. **Incrementally (Default & Recommended):** We'll implement each platform layer step-by-step (Foundation → Container Platform → GitOps → Service Mesh → Developer Experience), validating integration at each stage. This ensures thorough testing and operational readiness.
  B. **"YOLO" Mode:** I'll implement the complete platform stack in logical groups, with validation at major integration milestones. This is faster but requires comprehensive end-to-end testing."
- Request the user to select their preferred mode and proceed accordingly.

### 2. Architecture Review & Implementation Planning

- Review Infrastructure Architecture Document for complete platform specifications
