# Infrastructure Architecture Creation Task

## Purpose

To design a comprehensive infrastructure architecture that defines all aspects of the technical infrastructure strategy, from cloud platform selection to deployment patterns. This architecture will serve as the definitive blueprint for the DevOps/Platform Engineering team to implement, ensuring consistency, security, and operational excellence across all infrastructure components.

## Inputs

- Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Main System Architecture Document
- Technology Stack Document (`docs/tech-stack.md`)
- Infrastructure Guidelines (`docs/infrastructure/guidelines.md`)
- Any existing infrastructure documentation

## Key Activities & Instructions

### 1. Confirm Interaction Mode

- Ask the user: "How would you like to proceed with creating the infrastructure architecture? We can work:
  A. **Incrementally (Default & Recommended):** We'll go through each architectural decision and document section step-by-step. I'll present drafts, and we'll seek your feedback before moving to the next part. This is best for complex infrastructure designs.
  B. **"YOLO" Mode:** I can produce a comprehensive initial draft of the infrastructure architecture for you to review more broadly first. We can then iterate on specific sections based on your feedback."
- Request the user to select their preferred mode and proceed accordingly.

### 2. Gather Infrastructure Requirements

- Review the product requirements document to understand business needs and scale requirements
- Analyze the main system architecture to identify infrastructure dependencies
- Document non-functional requirements (performance, scalability, reliability, security)
- Identify compliance and regulatory requirements affecting infrastructure
- Map application architecture patterns to infrastructure needs
- <critical_rule>Cross-reference with PRD Technical Assumptions to ensure alignment with repository and service architecture decisions</critical_rule>

### 3. Design Infrastructure Architecture Strategy

- **If "Incremental Mode" was selected:**
  - For each major infrastructure domain:
    - **a. Present Domain Purpose:** Explain what this infrastructure domain provides and its strategic importance
    - **b. Present Strategic Options:** Provide 2-3 viable approaches with architectural pros and cons
    - **c. Make Strategic Recommendation:** Recommend the best approach with clear architectural rationale
    - **d. Incorporate Feedback:** Discuss with user and iterate based on feedback
    - **e. [Offer Advanced Self-Refinement & Elicitation Options](#offer-advanced-self-refinement--elicitation-options)**
    - **f. Document Architectural Decision:** Record the final strategic choice with justification

- **If "YOLO Mode" was selected:**
  - Design strategic approaches for all major infrastructure domains
  - Document architectural decisions and rationales
  - Present comprehensive infrastructure strategy for review
  - Iterate based on feedback

### 4. Document Infrastructure Architecture Blueprint

- Populate all sections of the infrastructure architecture template:
  - **Cloud Strategy & Platform Selection** - Multi-cloud vs single cloud, platform rationale
  - **Network Architecture Patterns** - VPC design, connectivity strategies, security zones
  - **Compute Architecture Strategy** - Container vs serverless vs VM strategies, scaling patterns
  - **Data Architecture & Storage Strategy** - Database selection, data tier strategies, backup approaches
  - **Security Architecture Framework** - Zero-trust patterns, identity strategies, encryption approaches
  - **Observability Architecture** - Monitoring strategies, logging patterns, alerting frameworks
  - **CI/CD Architecture Patterns** - Pipeline strategies, deployment patterns, environment promotion
  - **Disaster Recovery Architecture** - RTO/RPO strategies, failover patterns, business continuity
  - **Cost Optimization Framework** - Resource optimization strategies, cost allocation patterns
  - **Environment Strategy** - Dev/staging/prod patterns, environment isolation approaches
  - **Infrastructure Evolution Strategy** - Technology migration paths, scaling roadmaps
  - **Cross-team Collaboration Model** - Integration with development teams, handoff protocols

### 5. Implementation Feasibility Review & Collaboration

- **Architect â†’ DevOps/Platform Feedback Loop:**
  - Present architectural blueprint summary to DevOps/Platform Engineering Agent for feasibility review
  - Request specific feedback on:
    - **Operational Complexity:** Are the proposed patterns implementable with current tooling and expertise?
    - **Resource Constraints:** Do infrastructure requirements align with available resources and budgets?
    - **Security Implementation:** Are security patterns achievable with current security toolchain?
    - **Operational Overhead:** Will the proposed architecture create excessive operational burden?
    - **Technology Constraints:** Are selected technologies compatible with existing infrastructure?
  - Document all feasibility feedback and concerns raised by DevOps/Platform Engineering Agent
  - Iterate on architectural decisions based on operational constraints and feedback
  - <critical_rule>Address all critical feasibility concerns before proceeding to final architecture documentation</critical_rule>

### 6. Create Infrastructure Architecture Diagrams

- Develop high-level infrastructure strategy diagrams using Mermaid
- Create network topology architecture diagrams
- Document data flow and integration architecture diagrams
- Illustrate deployment pipeline architecture patterns
- Visualize environment relationship and promotion strategies
- Design security architecture and trust boundary diagrams

### 7. Define Implementation Handoff Strategy

- Create clear specifications for DevOps/Platform Engineering implementation
- Define architectural constraints and non-negotiable requirements
- Specify technology selections with version requirements where critical
- Document architectural patterns that must be followed during implementation
- Create implementation validation criteria
- Prepare architectural decision records (ADRs) for key infrastructure choices

### 8. BMAD Integration Architecture

- Design infrastructure architecture to support other BMAD agents:
  - **Development Environment Architecture** - Local development patterns, testing infrastructure
  - **Deployment Architecture** - How applications from Frontend/Backend agents will be deployed
  - **Integration Architecture** - How infrastructure supports cross-service communication
  - Document infrastructure requirements for each BMAD agent workflow

### 9. Architecture Review and Finalization

- Review architecture against system architecture for alignment
- Validate infrastructure architecture supports all application requirements
- Ensure architectural decisions are implementable within project constraints
- Address any architectural gaps or inconsistencies
- Prepare comprehensive architecture handoff documentation for implementation team

## Output

A comprehensive infrastructure architecture document that provides:

1. **Strategic Infrastructure Blueprint** - High-level architecture strategy and patterns
2. **Technology Selection Rationale** - Justified technology choices and architectural decisions
3. **Implementation Specifications** - Clear guidance for DevOps/Platform Engineering implementation
4. **Architectural Constraints** - Non-negotiable requirements and patterns
