# Change Navigation Checklist

**Purpose:** To systematically guide the selected Agent and user through the analysis and planning required when a significant change (pivot, tech issue, missing requirement, failed story) is identified during the BMAD workflow.

**Instructions:** Review each item with the user. Mark `[x]` for completed/confirmed, `[N/A]` if not applicable, or add notes for discussion points.

---

## 1. Understand the Trigger & Context

- [ ] **Identify Triggering Story:** Clearly identify the story (or stories) that revealed the issue.
- [ ] **Define the Issue:** Articulate the core problem precisely.
  - [ ] Is it a technical limitation/dead-end?
  - [ ] Is it a newly discovered requirement?
  - [ ] Is it a fundamental misunderstanding of existing requirements?
  - [ ] Is it a necessary pivot based on feedback or new information?
  - [ ] Is it a failed/abandoned story needing a new approach?
- [ ] **Assess Initial Impact:** Describe the immediate observed consequences (e.g., blocked progress, incorrect functionality, non-viable tech).
- [ ] **Gather Evidence:** Note any specific logs, error messages, user feedback, or analysis that supports the issue definition.

## 2. Epic Impact Assessment

- [ ] **Analyze Current Epic:**
  - [ ] Can the current epic containing the trigger story still be completed?
  - [ ] Does the current epic need modification (story changes, additions, removals)?
  - [ ] Should the current epic be abandoned or fundamentally redefined?
- [ ] **Analyze Future Epics:**
  - [ ] Review all remaining planned epics.
  - [ ] Does the issue require changes to planned stories in future epics?
  - [ ] Does the issue invalidate any future epics?
  - [ ] Does the issue necessitate the creation of entirely new epics?
  - [ ] Should the order/priority of future epics be changed?
- [ ] **Summarize Epic Impact:** Briefly document the overall effect on the project's epic structure and flow.

## 3. Artifact Conflict & Impact Analysis

- [ ] **Review PRD:**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with the core goals or requirements stated in the PRD?
  - [ ] Does the PRD need clarification or updates based on the new understanding?
- [ ] **Review Architecture Document:**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with the documented architecture (components, patterns, tech choices)?
  - [ ] Are specific components/diagrams/sections impacted?
  - [ ] Does the technology list need updating?
  - [ ] Do data models or schemas need revision?
  - [ ] Are external API integrations affected?
- [ ] **Review Frontend Spec (if applicable):**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with the FE architecture, component library choice, or UI/UX design?
  - [ ] Are specific FE components or user flows impacted?
- [ ] **Review Other Artifacts (if applicable):**
  - [ ] Consider impact on deployment scripts, IaC, monitoring setup, etc.
- [ ] **Summarize Artifact Impact:** List all artifacts requiring updates and the nature of the changes needed.

## 4. Path Forward Evaluation

- [ ] **Option 1: Direct Adjustment / Integration:**
  - [ ] Can the issue be addressed by modifying/adding future stories within the existing plan?
  - [ ] Define the scope and nature of these adjustments.
  - [ ] Assess feasibility, effort, and risks of this path.
- [ ] **Option 2: Potential Rollback:**
  - [ ] Would reverting completed stories significantly simplify addressing the issue?
  - [ ] Identify specific stories/commits to consider for rollback.
  - [ ] Assess the effort required for rollback.
  - [ ] Assess the impact of rollback (lost work, data implications).
  - [ ] Compare the net benefit/cost vs. Direct Adjustment.
- [ ] **Option 3: PRD MVP Review & Potential Re-scoping:**
  - [ ] Is the original PRD MVP still achievable given the issue and constraints?
  - [ ] Does the MVP scope need reduction (removing features/epics)?
  - [ ] Do the core MVP goals need modification?
  - [ ] Are alternative approaches needed to meet the original MVP intent?
  - [ ] **Extreme Case:** Does the issue necessitate a fundamental replan or potentially a new PRD V2 (to be handled by PM)?
- [ ] **Select Recommended Path:** Based on the evaluation, agree on the most viable path forward.

## 5. Sprint Change Proposal Components

(Ensure all agreed-upon points from previous sections are captured in the proposal)

- [ ] **PRD MVP Impact:** Changes to scope/goals (if any).
- [ ] **High-Level Action Plan:** Next steps for stories/updates.
- [ ] **Agent Handoff Plan:** Identify roles needed (PM, Arch, Design Arch, PO).

## 6. Final Review & Handoff

- [ ] **Review Checklist:** Confirm all relevant items were discussed.
- [ ] **Review Sprint Change Proposal:** Ensure it accurately reflects the discussion and decisions.
- [ ] **User Approval:** Obtain explicit user approval for the proposal.
- [ ] **Confirm Next Steps:** Reiterate the handoff plan and the next actions to be taken by specific agents.
