# Game Architect Solution Validation Checklist (Godot)

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the Game Architect to validate the technical design and architecture for Godot game development. The Game Architect should systematically work through each item, ensuring the game architecture is robust, scalable, performant, and aligned with the Game Design Document requirements while leveraging Godot's strengths.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - REQUIRED ARTIFACTS

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. architecture.md - The primary game architecture document (check docs/architecture.md)
2. game-design-doc.md - Game Design Document for game requirements alignment (check docs/game-design-doc.md)
3. Any system diagrams referenced in the architecture
4. Godot project structure documentation
5. Game balance and configuration specifications
6. Platform target specifications
7. Performance profiling data if available

IMPORTANT: If any required documents are missing or inaccessible, immediately ask the user for their location or content before proceeding.

GAME PROJECT TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the game project type by checking:

- Is this a 2D or 3D Godot game project?
- What platforms are targeted (mobile, desktop, web, console)?
- What are the core game mechanics from the GDD?
- Are there specific performance requirements (60 FPS, mobile constraints)?
- Will the project use GDScript, C#, or both?

VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each section, you must:

1. Deep Analysis - Don't just check boxes, thoroughly analyze each item against the provided documentation
2. Evidence-Based - Cite specific sections or quotes from the documents when validating
3. Critical Thinking - Question assumptions and identify gaps, not just confirm what's present
4. Performance Focus - Consider frame rate impact, draw calls, and memory usage for every architectural decision
5. Language Balance - Evaluate whether GDScript vs C# choices are appropriate for each system

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, present findings, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present comprehensive report at end]]
